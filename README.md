#Game

This is a game created by three friends who have an interest in teaching and learning. We wanted to create a spelling game for grade 1-3 students and make it as interactive as possible. A big part of this was allowing the user to view the picture and then guess what the photo is. We are still working on a version where the user will not have to use something else external like copy pasting the image and then going back to code. Stay tuned!
